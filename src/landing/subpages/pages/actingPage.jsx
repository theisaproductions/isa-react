                        Outstation students can choose between various accommodation preferences including Paying Guest, Hotels,
                        Service Apartments and Rentals facilities. Expenses for accommodation in NCR starts from Rs 4,000 per month
                        for hostel facilities, PG facilities and onwards depending on the preferred type of accommodation and
                        location.
                        A list of accommodation facilities that has been compiled by us from contacts received by our students. Many
                        of the ISA students are staying in PG and flats. For help and guidance on accommodation, you may contact on
                        this number: <a className='font-bold text-blue-700' href="tel:+918077441855">+91 - 8077441855</a>.
