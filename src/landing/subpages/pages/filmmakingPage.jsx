                    <p className='paragraph'>
                    Film-making is the art of creating an engaging and captivating visual narrative. It begins with selecting a compelling story, followed by shooting, directing, scripting, editing, and ultimately presenting it to an audience. The ultimate goal of film making is to capture the viewers' attention and create a lasting impact.</p>
                    <p className='paragraph'>
                        It all starts with imagination, ideas and the script. Creative producers and screenwriters learn to analyze
                        and write screenplays by understanding character, structure and narrative story elements. From pre-production,
                        into production and finally post-production. Filmmakers will perfect both the creative and business aspects of
                        filmmaking by enhancing and developing artistic proficiency and judgment, becoming immersed in a solid
                        background of the entertainment industry.
