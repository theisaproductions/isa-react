                    <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">ISA is one of the best acting and film schools of India founded in Delhi - NCR by Mr.
                        Sagar Kohli, who is an actor, filmmaker and entrepreneur. Mr. Sagar
                        Kohli has
                        discovered a new method of acting called Realism which is taught to the acting students of ISA. <br/><br/>
                        The idea of the school is to provide the aspiring actors and artists a realistic approach towards the art of
                        acting, films and
                        performing arts in a customized fashion depending upon what they need to learn the most to excel the craft
                        and help them find the right practical work in the industry.
                        <br/><br/>
                        After becoming the best acting school in India, The Indian School of Acting , expanded its curriculum to
                        several areas of arts along with its global presence by having students, enquiries and clients coming in
                        from
                        all
                        over
                        the world and becoming ISA Film School. At ISA, students can choose from a wide range of visual and
                        performing
                        arts programs
                        that includes Filmmaking, Acting for Films and TV, 3D Animation & Visual Effects, Music, Art, Dance,
                        Cinematography,

                        arts.

                        scams out
                        there, neither while learning nor while finding work, as we protect them. We seek a limited number of
                        students
                        per
                        batch and ensure laser sharp focus on their improvements. We are an improvement oriented film school with
                        our
                        top objective to make you the best artist out there.
